					<!-- How To Add Notes -->
					<aside class="notes">
					When I started in WS2 we were using sprint planning where tickets or jobs were given priorities in meetings held every two weeks. This was later moved to towards Kanban approach to agile development.

					During the business as usual work  I did some pairing work,  although primarily I was with Work stream 2 I worked on the front end taking a look at css and in turn sass (which I had no experience) as well as the back end with work stream 2 in form of javascript. during this work I was introduced to the TDD And BDD as a way of working which in turn reinforce with the training days.

						<li class="fragment"><code>Weekly or monthly table</code></li>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Response form devlopers</code></li>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Problems with awarding points</code></li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">

					This is the first project I worked on during my time here. Keith had the goal that he Wanted to improve coding quality and maybe have a little friendly competition at the same time. (not sure if thats possible based on how the super cup turned out)
					 
					with this goal in mind he came up with the idea to ‘gamify’ git hub by awarding points to tickets completed creating a  league table between developers that would reset weekly or monthly (level playing field) with possibility of prizes for those fishing first. After discussing with John we came up with awarding points based on additions and deletions and time of completion, but after discussing a bit more we realised that this could be easily exploited and after speaking few devs who also thought it couldn’t really be done due to the wide variety of tickets for dev to complete.

						<h2>Github Sports Stats</h2>
						<p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Display stats gained from the Github Api</code></li>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Provide helpful data to devs</code></li>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Data From Api already displayed on Github</code></li>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Sonar Qube</code></li>
					 </ul>
					 <aside class ="notes">
					After Deciding that the Gamification wouldn’t work as a concept  and we didn’t really want to just throw away the work we put in to getting data from the git hub Api. thats were we came up with idea of displaying the data in way that was helpful to 

					\developers. we did get it displaying this data (screenshot) but struggled to make it actually useful to developers seeing as the data is already available from git hub website. 

					trying to keep the goal of improving code quality we took a look at Sonar Qube which is a platform that inspects code quality covering a wide range of different programming languages. we got this working (screenshot of sonar cube) and might be looked into the future when it is put into cosmos. it’s not without it’s problems

					<h2>Introduced To</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Bootstrap</code></li>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Node.js</code></li>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Model View Controller (MVC)</code></li>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Pub/sub</code></li>
						<li class="fragment"><code>MongoDB</code></li>
					</ul>
					<aside class ="notes">
						During these projects I was introduced to Bootstrap which I’d had very little experience with previously, node.js which featured in all of the projects I ended up working on. A couple of design patterns which included Model View Controller and Pub/Sub. and there was mongoDB  which is a non-sql which fits nicely with documents that use schemas like Json files.

						<li class="fragment"><code>Made in two day</code></li>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Angular.js</code></li>
					</ul>
					<aside class ="notes">
						I took part in the BBC sport hack day where I worked with John and shaun with crouch joining later on probably succeeding in getting in the way mostly for the two days it was worked on. Mack Is a tool for creating the Layout config Json used in webpages (demo). since the hack day J.C has added to mack

						<li class="fragment"><code>Idea from summer of innovation</code></li>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Sponsored project</code></li>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Route recorder with challenges set by other users and hopefully celebrities</code></li>
					</ul>
					<aside class ="notes">
						with the other projects deemed as not worth continuing with or in case of the sonar waiting for other services. John came up with the idea of letting me have a go at the app he worked on for the summer of innovation which was the BBC fitness app which was also a sponsored product. (maybe explanation of that) (demo) explain whats going on with the app.

					<h2>How it works</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Swift Programming language</code></li>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Node.js</code></li>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Sql and Sqlite</code></li>
					</ul>
					<aside class ="notes">
						Written in the apple made swift programming language which is still in beta at the moment and can go through some changes until the full version which could mean this app won’t work. I enjoyed working with swift the syntax is quite nice and this the first app I had worked on which again was enjoyable. It used node js again and we used Sqlite for the relational database and in turn to deal with the Json data we got.

					<h2>Applying to work outside the BBC</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Programming knowledge</code></li>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Design patterns</code></li>
						<li class="fragment"><code>TDD/BDD</code></li>
						<li class="fragment"><code>Exposure to various libraries and frameworks</code></li>
					</ul>
					<aside class ="notes">
						I feel like I have gained a lot more programming knowledge during my time here. Learning design patterns to help structure my code and the few different way of approaching coding (TDD and BDD).  and With the Exposure to different frameworks and Libraries I feel will all put me in good stead for future programming work and project.
